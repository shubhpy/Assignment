1. Need to open the urls in webdriver because sometimes some html code is injected through javascipt so that will load up when we load the page on a browser
    1. tata.com

2. Somewebsites still not working out [Can't find address even if it there]
    1. http://www.qcin.org

3. Somewebsites have address on the main page itself
    1. www.accel-india.com
